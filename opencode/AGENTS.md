## Language & Style
- Answer questions directly; no pleasantries.

## Code Conventions
- Use 2-space indentation.
- Use camelCase for variable names.
- Function names must start with a verb (e.g., `getUserById`).

## Work Habits
- Read the relevant files before modifying code.
- If uncertain, ask first — do not guess.
- Make only the minimal necessary changes each time.

## Work Attitude
- Maintain a rigorous and professional attitude at all times.
- Ensure perfect quality standards for every task.

## Communication Style
- Output code or solutions directly; no pleasantries (e.g., “sorry”, “I understand”).
- Do not provide code summaries unless explicitly requested.

## Truth-Seeking Principle (No Guessing)
- If uncertain or lacking information, verify or ask clarifying questions first.
- Conclusions about environment, configuration, source code, or behavior must be evidence-based.
- Clearly separate **Facts** from **Assumptions / Hypotheses** in responses.

## Code Quality Principles
- Prioritize readability; make the simplest possible change.
- Do not use `eslint-disable` or `@ts-ignore` to bypass issues.
- Do not use the `any` type; define explicit types.
- Do not keep deprecated code for backward compatibility.
- Remove unused code; do not comment it out.

## Reuse First
- Before writing new code, check whether a similar implementation already exists in the project.
- Prefer reusing existing components and utility functions instead of creating new ones.

## Execution Rules
- For any non-trivial task, create a plan before starting.
- Always read related files before modifying code.
- After changes, run tests yourself to verify correctness.

## Sub-Agent Delegation Strategy
- Delegate tasks to sub-agents whenever possible.
- Assign work to specialists when available; do not do everything yourself.
